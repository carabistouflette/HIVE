A subtask can only start after all its dependencies are completed. Dependencies should be listed by their titles.\\n\\nHigh-Level Objective: {{objective}}\\n\\nContext (if any): {{context}}\\n\\nOutput the subtasks in JSON format as a single JSON object containing a key \"subtasks\", which is an array of objects. Each object in the array must have the following fields:\\n- \"title\": A concise title for the subtask (must be unique within this decomposition).\\n- \"description\": A detailed description of what needs to be done for this subtask.\\n- \"dependencies\": An array of titles of other subtasks (from this decomposition) that this subtask depends on. If no dependencies, provide an empty array.\\n\\nExample of the expected JSON output format:\\n```json\\n{\\n  \"subtasks\": [\\n    {\\n      \"title\": \"Subtask A\",\\n      \"description\": \"Detailed steps for Subtask A.\",\\n      \"dependencies\": []\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \"title\": \"Subtask B\",\\n      \"description\": \"Detailed steps for Subtask B.\",\\n      \"dependencies\": [\"Subtask A\"]\\n    }\\n  ]\\n}\\n```\\n\\nPlease provide the list of subtasks based on the objective and context above, strictly adhering to the JSON output format."
